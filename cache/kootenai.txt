Backcountry Forecast from NWS Missoula issued:
240 PM MST Sun Dec 22 2019

DISCUSSION: Strong ridgetop winds, general southwesterly flow with
moisture riding over the axis of the ridge in northwest Montana, 
and unseasonably warm temperatures...where have we heard this
before? Hopefully today is the final day of these three persistent
features existing across the region. There is a cold front poised 
to cross the Northern Rockies late tonight into Monday morning, 
with colder air (aka: seasonable temperatures) expected to return,
which will produce light mountain snow across northwest Montana 
mountain ranges. By Tuesday, moisture moving up from the south may
bring about some light snow to the southern Bitterroots and 
Anaconda/Pintlers. All in all, not a very active period for 
snowfall, sadly.
